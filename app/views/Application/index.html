<div class="well">
This Play! application displays SOAP messages received on a raw Web service exposed at <a href="${wsdl}">${wsdl}</a>.
Even if there is a provided WSDL, there is no check on the message type. Messages are stored for <a href="@{Application.last}">static display</a> or directly pushed to clients with the help of <a href="@{Application.websocket}">Web sockets</a>.
